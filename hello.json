    "nutritional_advice": "A typical samosa, which is a fried or baked pastry with a savory filling, usually contains around 262 calories. This may vary depending on the size and specific ingredients used. \n\nNutritionally, samosas are high in fat and carbohydrates, specifically saturated fat because they are often deep-fried. They can also be high in sodium. While they do provide some protein and fiber, they're not a significant source of these nutrients.\n\nIf you're trying to eat healthily, consider enjoying samosas in moderation as part of a balanced diet. You could also try baking them instead of frying to reduce the fat content. Pairing them with a side of fresh vegetables or a salad can also help balance out the meal."
